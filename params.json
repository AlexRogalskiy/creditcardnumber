{"name":"Credit card number","tagline":"Java 6 library that can provide details of a bank issued credit card number","body":"# Credit Card Number\r\n\r\n*Credit Card Number* is a Java library that can provide details of a bank issued credit card number. \r\n\r\nAll classes are immutable and thread-safe. The standard `toString()` function formats data in a readable form. Validity is enforced by JUnit tests. Java 6 or newer is required. In order to be Java 8 ready, Credit Card Number depends on Stephen Colebourne's [ThreeTen backport project](https://github.com/ThreeTen/threetenbp), a port of [JSR 310](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310) to Java 6. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to use publicly and freely available documentation to create a reliable Java library to provide information about credit card numbers.\r\n\r\nSome resources consulted are:\r\n* [Bank card number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_card_number)\r\n* [How do you detect Credit card type based on number?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/72768/how-do-you-detect-credit-card-type-based-on-number)  \r\n* [Finding or Verifying Credit Card Numbers](http://www.regular-expressions.info/creditcard.html)\r\n* [Major Industry Identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_card_number#Major_Industry_Identifier_.28MII.29)\r\n* [Luhn Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm)\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nYou can [download the jar on the Maven Central Repository](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22credit_card_number%22).\r\n\r\n## Maven Build\r\n\r\nTo use *Credit Card Number* in your Maven build, include the following dependency. No repositories references are needed, since the jars are in the Maven Central Repository.\r\n```xml\r\n<dependency>\r\n    <groupId>us.fatehi</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>credit_card_number</artifactId>\r\n    <version>1.3</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n### How to Get Bank Card Information\r\n\r\nTo get bank card information, use code like:\r\n```java\r\nfinal PrimaryAccountNumber pan = new AccountNumber(\"5266-0922-0141-6174\");\r\nfinal BankCard card = new BankCard(pan);\r\nSystem.out.println(card);\r\n```\r\nand you will get this output:\r\n```\r\nBank Card Information: \r\n  Primary Account Number: 5266092201416174\r\n  Primary Account Number (Secure): MasterCard-6174\r\n    Major Industry Identifier: 5 - Banking and financial\r\n    Issuer Identification Number: 526609\r\n    Card Brand: MasterCard\r\n    Last Four Digits: 6174\r\n    Passes Luhn Check? Yes\r\n    Is Primary Account Number Valid? Yes\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How to Secure the Credit Card Number\r\n\r\nIf you need the account number information, but want to be secure by not storing the actual primary account number in memory, you can use code like:\r\n```java\r\nfinal PrimaryAccountNumber pan = \r\n  new AccountNumberInfo(new AccountNumber(\"5266-0922-0141-6174\"));\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
